# EF Core & APIs

## This tutorial teaches ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core with controllers and views. Razor Pages is an alternative programming model that was introduced in ASP.NET Core 2.0. For new development, we recommend Razor Pages over MVC with controllers and views.

### Entity Framework Core

 1. Entity Framework (EF) Core is a lightweight, extensible, open source and cross-platform version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology.

 1. EF Core can serve as an object-relational mapper (O/RM), enabling .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects, and eliminating the need for most of the data-access code they usually need to write.

 1. EF Core supports many database engines, see Database Providers for details.
 
 #### Data Seeding
 
 DEF: Data seeding is the process of populating a database with an initial set of data.

#### There are several ways this can be accomplished in EF Core:

  1. Model seed data
  1. Manual migration customization
  1. Custom initialization logic
