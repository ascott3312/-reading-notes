-- Place any code statements that might raise or throw an exception in a try block, and place statements used to handle the exception or exceptions in one or more catch blocks below the try block. Each catch block includes the exception type and can contain additional statements needed to handle that exception type.


### Handling I/O errors in .NEt
-- In addition to the exceptions that can be thrown in any method call (such as an OutOfMemoryException when a system is stressed or an NullReferenceException due to programmer error), .NET file system methods can throw the following exceptions:

The Therac-25 was a computer-controlled radiation therapy machine produced by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) in 1982 after the Therac-6 and Therac-20 units (the earlier units had been produced in partnership with CGR of France).

It was involved in at least six accidents between 1985 and 1987, in which patients were given massive overdoses of radiation.[1]:425 Because of concurrent programming errors, it sometimes gave its patients radiation doses that were hundreds of times greater than normal, resulting in death or serious injury.[2] These accidents highlighted the dangers of software control of safety-critical systems, and they have become a standard case study in health informatics and software engineering. Additionally the overconfidence of the engineers[1]:428 and lack of proper due diligence to resolve reported soft
